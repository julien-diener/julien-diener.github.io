# Julien DIener's personal website

Build with jekyll, for github pages

## setup

 - install jekyll
 - clone
 - deploy live (on port 5000): `jekyll serve --port 5000 --incremental`
 - build static: `jekyll build --baseurl $PWD/_site/`

There is some issue regarding baseurl when building

## Source

This website has been build based on the carte-noire theme. 

I have made quite some changes and the source would need some proper cleanup. Especially the css files.
But as of now, I don't expect to spend much more time on the site structure and appearance, so I followed *YAGNI* instead of *refactor mercilessly*.
