The goal of my research is to provide a metrological study comparing well-known algorithms to compute the optical flow of video sequences. In particular, we are interested by videos of plants motion (more specifically single trees) which represent particularly complex cases for image processing techniques. This work is part of a larger research project studying the bio-mechanics of plants. Here I focused on developing a method to [study plant dynamics and structure using video data](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192313002712).

Through this project, I have coded the [CR matlab toolbox](http://sites.google.com/site/crtoolbox) containing a set of algorithms that allows the extraction of motion data out of video sequences. This toolbox proposes a user friendly interface designed to be used by scientists who are not specialized in image processing.

This post-doc is founded by the [ANR research project ChÃªne-Roseau](http://www.ladhyx.polytechnique.fr/public_cr/bmv-cheneroseau.html).
