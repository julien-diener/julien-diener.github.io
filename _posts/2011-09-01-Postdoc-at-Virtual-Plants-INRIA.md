I worked on a research project to automate the extraction of root system architecture of plants from image sequences. This work was part of on the [RhizoScan project]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-01-01-Rhizoscan %}). And I participated to the development of the [RSML file format]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-08-01-RSML %})
