I was one of the initial IT of [the ICA](http://www.the-ica.com) start up. We developed big-compute technologies and BI for financial risk analysis. We used all the new cloud tech that could help us leverage some very high computing and distributed data challenges.

My role was to be a leading architect of our solution, spanning from distributed computing to pricing of derivative products and financial metrics. One of my main specialty was to cope with all expertise of the companies. And as such, I had a central position regarding the design of the main computational workflow.

Since my time at the ICA, the company changed name (it is now called opensee) and also its main product to better target its client needs.
