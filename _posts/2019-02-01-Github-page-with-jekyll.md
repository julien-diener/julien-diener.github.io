This personal website is not very used and even if it was nice to have an AWS server hosting it, it clearly doesn't require it. So beginning of 2019, I exported all posts from the site and repackage it in a static website, hosted by [Github-Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). 

Because I don't want to code everything myself, I followed github recommendation [to use Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll), looked for a theme/template I like, and adapted it to add a couple of features and have the desired style (I'm no artist so I keep it simple). 

I then retrieved all posts from my wordpress DB, and refactored them as post files for jekyll. In the end, I did it manually (export database, copy-paste and adapt the content into the suitable format). as I don't have many posts: making a script would have taken much more time. 

Here is the result :)
