Skilled bigdata and cloud architect, I specialise in digital transformation of complex computational  chains. I am a strong believer of agile methods to optimise productivity while keeping a meaningful and sustainable work for the IT teams. Having worked in many different environments and with a large spectrum of collaborators and specialties, I think I am a good communicator that identifies and conveys importantes information in order to make the best decisions.
