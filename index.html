      <p> I am Julien Diener, currently living in Paris. This is my personal website </p>

      <p>
        I have been coding since I am a kid. After a B.Sc. in Math at Heriot-Watt University (Edinburgh), 
        I got a Ph.D. in Computer Graphics at INPG (Grenoble). I then worked in several projects, with physicists, biologists, 
        and now with quants (the math part of finance).
      </p>
      <p>
          So, on one hand, I think I am a good coder with strong math skill. And I consider my-self a Full-Stack Hacker:</p>
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li> <em>Full-Stack</em> because I make decisions based on all involved components and efficiency of the development process </li>
          <li> <em>Hacker</em> because I like to find and take advantages from the subtleties-that-matter </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p> 
        And on the other hand, during my career working with many different people and topics, I became particularly proficient for 
        the design of numerical workflow in complex, interdisciplinary, projects. Also, I developed a strong managerial sense 
        based on two main principles:
        <ul>
          <li> Honesty: to put it simply, the expectation of all collaborators, and clients, should be clear </li>
          <li> Short cycles and agility: every communication, development and test steps should be as short, frequent and
              automatized as possible. Agile methods are here to help us. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
