      <p> I am Julien Diener, currently living in Paris. This is my personal website.</p>

      <p>
        I have been coding since I am a kid. After a B.Sc. in Math at the Heriot-Watt University (Edinburgh), 
        I got a Ph.D. in Computer Graphics at INPG (Grenoble). I then worked in several projects, with physicists, biologists, 
        and now with quants (the math part of finance). I think I am a good coder, with strong math skill. 
        But my best specialty is the design of complex numerical workflow in interdisciplinary projects.
      </p>
      <p> I consider my-self a Full-Stack Hacker:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> <em>Full-Stack</em> because I make decisions based on all involved components and efficiency of the development process </li>
        <li> <em>Hacker</em> because I like to find and take advantages from the subtleties-that-matter </li>
      </ul>
