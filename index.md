I am Julien Diener, currently living in Paris. This is my personal website which acts as a CV.

* This site is currently under revision *

I have been coding since I am a kid. After a B.Sc. in Math at the Heriot-Watt University (Edinburgh), I got a Ph.D. in Computer Graphics at INPG (Grenoble). I then worked in several projects, with physicists, biologists, and now with quants (the math part of finance). I think I am a good coder, with strong math skill. But my best specialty is the design of complex numerical workflow in interdisciplinary projects.

I consider my-self a Full-Stack Hacker

 - _Full-Stack_ because I make decisions based on all involved components and efficiency of the development  process
 - _Hacker_ because I like to find and take advantages from the subtleties-that-matter
